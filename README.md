# DRLC4
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Connect4

An implementation of Connect4 and a neural network based agent that will train itself to play Connect4 by playing against itself.
This was a (naive) experiment to see if this was possible without the use of Monte Carlos Tree Search (MTCS). Unfortunately, it is not possible to train an agent to play against itself and see an increase in performance without the use of MTCS.


## Installation

You must insure that PyTorch is installed.

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/christian-traylor/DRLC4.git
cd repo
```

## Usage

To run the game and commence the training:
``` bash
python game.py
```
