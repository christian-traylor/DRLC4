# MLC4
This was a (naive) experiment to determine if two deep reinforcement learning agents can learn how to play Connect4 by only playing games against each other.
This doesn't work, because the RL learning algorithm expects to be playing against a perfrect opponent, which neither of them are.

To fix this issue, you must use Monte Carlos tree search.

The ideas and algorithms presented in this codebase should work for singleplayer games.
